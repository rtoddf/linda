					  <p>One of the most popular Biblical stories comes to life in this beautiful telling of the story of David and the eternal love triangle between him, Bathsheba and Uriah. The dramatic music is enchanting and ranges from simple strains to the complexity of a powerrful sextet.  Enjoy the antics of the Prophet, the lighthearted Goliath segment, and finally the dramatic, heart warming acceptance of forgiveness.</p>
